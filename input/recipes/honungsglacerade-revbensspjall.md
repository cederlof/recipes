1 kg pork spareribs

#### Marinade

* 80 ml honey
* 60 ml soy sauce
* 45 ml oyster sauce
* 30 ml soft brown sugar
* 7 cm piece ginger , grated
* 3 garlic cloves , crushed
* 15 ml tomato paste
* 1 ml salt
* 1 ml cayenne pepper
* 1 ml ground cinnamon
* 5 ml rosemary

*Tveka inte, kör lite mer honung och lite mer soja!!*

Arrange the spareribs in a single layer in a nonmetallic dish.
Mix all the ingredients for the marinade together and pour over the spareribs.
If you don't really like ginger that much you may find it a bit over powering and would want to reduce it.

Cover and refrigerate for at least **8 hours or overnight**.
Preheat the oven to *190°C* and arrange the ribs on the rack of a roasting pan.
These were great!!! My only comment is that I can't image cooking ribs for only **50-60 minutes. I cooked mine for 2 1/2 hours**, and they were fantastic!

Oven roast for **50-60 minutes**, basting occasionally with the marinade.
Turn every **10 minutes**. Or just throw them on the BBQ.
Cut the ribs into portions and serve.
