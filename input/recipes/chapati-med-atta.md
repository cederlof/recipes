Gör dem inte för tunna!

####Method

In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt well.
Add oil and mix again to incorporate the oil into the flour.
Slowly add warm water and knead to form a dough.
Shape dough into a ball and rub a few drops of oil on it to coat.
Cover and let it stand for at least 15 minutes.

Knead dough once more and divide it into 9 ping pong size balls.
Roll each ball in your palms and press into a flat circle.
Put ½ cup of whole wheat flour in a flat bowl or dish.
Dip a flattened ball into the dry flour and coat it on all sides.
Using a rolling pin, roll out each ball into a flat disc – similar to a tortilla.
Keep dipping the dough into the dry flour while rolling so it doesn’t stick.

Heat a tava or skillet on medium heat.
Place the rolled chapatti on the skillet.
When bubbles start to form, flip the chapatti over.
After about 10-15 seconds, smear the chapatti with a little oil and flip over.
With a spatula, press the chapatti to make it balloon up.
Smear the other side with a little oil and flip over again.
Keep pressing on the bubbles gently to make the entire chapatti rise up.
Chapatti is done when all the raw dough appears cooked.
