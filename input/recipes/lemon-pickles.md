Title: Lemon Pickle from Jamie's 30 Minute Meals
Category: Indiskt
Description: pickles, side-dish, jamie oliver
---

* 1 lemon
* 2 teaspoons mustard seeds
* 1 level teaspoon turmeric
* ¼ of a fresh red chilli
* 1 small dried chilli
* a pinch of salt

Cut the lemon into eighths, then de-seed and finely slice. Finely slice the red chilli quarter. 
Put a small pan on to a medium to high heat. 
Add a drizzle of olive oil to the pan and the mustard seeds, turmeric and the sliced chilli. 
Crumble in the dried chilli. When everything starts to sizzle, add the sliced lemon and a pinch of salt, count to ten, (although I say cook for a minute or the lemon rind is hard) then take off the heat and put in a bowl to cool.
