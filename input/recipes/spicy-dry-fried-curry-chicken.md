#### INGREDIENTS

* 1 (2 to 3 pound) whole chicken
* 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
* 1 tablespoon ground coriander
* 2 teaspoons black pepper
* 1 1/2 tablespoons chili powder
* 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
* 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 1 teaspoon mustard seeds
* 1 teaspoon fenugreek seeds
* 1 large onion, sliced
* 1 1/2 teaspoons cumin seeds
* 3 leaves fresh curry
* 2 teaspoons ginger paste
* 1 teaspoon garlic paste
* 2 cups water
* 1 cup coconut milk
* 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice

#### DIRECTIONS

Clean, and cut chicken (no skin) into 12 to 14 pieces. Place chicken in a large bowl, and season with turmeric powder, coriander powder, black pepper, chili powder, and salt. Cover bowl, and refrigerate for 1 hour.
Heat oil in a large pan over medium heat. Fry mustard seeds, fenugreek, onion, cumin seeds, and curry leaves inn oil for about 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in garlic and ginger pastes, and cook for another 2 minutes. Add chicken and water (kanske inte så mycket vatten? blev lite väl vattnig sist...), stir, and cover with lid. Cook for 20 to 25 minutes.
Stir in coconut milk, and cook until almost dry. Stir to keep the chicken from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Stir in lime juice, and cook until dry.

Garnish with curry leaves if desired.
