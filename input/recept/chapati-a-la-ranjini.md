Take wheat flour (make sure it is not the finest quality, graham - använd BARA vetemjöl enl. Gunlög, annars blir de torra och hårda!), add salt and mix thoroughly. Add water to make the paste until the dough sticks to your hand. Press gently and add butter so that it get away from your palm. Continue pressing until the dough became a one big globe without any skrynkor. Keep it away for half-an-hour. Have a piece of cloty or lid on, so the surface does not dry! After half-an-hour make small balls and make chapathi out of it!
