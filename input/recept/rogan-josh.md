Michelin-starred chef Atul Kochhar shows you how to make a lamb rogan josh curry in this step-by-step video.

TIP: Onions are key to a good Rogan Josh, cook them until they're deep brown for a rich, dark sauce

* Serves 4
* Prep in 20 mins 
* Cook in 30 mins 
* Marinate for 2 hrs
* Freeze it

####Ingredients

* 150g natural yogurt 
* pinch saffron
* 50g ginger-garlic paste (see separate recipe) 
* 1kg boneless lamb leg, cut into cubes
* 1½ tsp cumin seeds 
* 8 cardamom pods
* 2½cm cinnamon stick 
* 8 cloves 
* 1 star anise
* 100ml olive oil 
* 2 large onions, peeled and thinly sliced 
* 1 tsp ground nutmeg 
* 1 tsp black pepper
* 1 heaped tbsp red chilli powder 
* 1½ tbsp ground coriander
* 1 tsp garam masala
* 1 tsp ground turmeric
* 4 tbsp tomato purée 
* 1 bunch fresh coriander leaves, finely chopped 
* 3cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and julienned

####Method

1. Whisk together the yogurt, saffron and ginger-garlic paste. Season with salt then pour over the lamb. Cover and leave to marinate in the fridge for 2 hours. Bring the lamb to room temperature before cooking. 
2. Pound the whole spices with a pestle and mortar to release the oils. Heat the oil in a heavy-based pan then add the pounded spices and stir until the spices crackle. 
3. Add the onions immediately after the spices crackle to stop them from burning. Stir and cook until the onions are golden brown. 
4. Add the lamb with the marinade to the pan and cook until the meat is browned but not cooked through. It might stick to the pan but don't worry. Keep stirring and scraping the pan to develop the flavours. You can add a splash of water or lamb stock if the mixture becomes too dry.
5. Add all the powdered spices and cook for 5 minutes. 
6. Add the tomato purée and stir until the lamb is cooked through. Serve garnished with coriander and thin shreds of ginger.
