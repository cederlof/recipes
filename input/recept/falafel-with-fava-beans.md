Title: Falafel with Fava Beans and Chickpeas
Category: Middag
Description: falafel
---

I soaked about 400g (half the bag)  of these big fava beans and about 200 g of chickpeas. I soaked them all for a really long time, over 24 hours.  Then it was onto the teatowels to dry out and be skinned. (only the fava beans were skinned, not the chickpeas which have softer skins)

We debated doing one lot with chickpeas and one lot with fava beans and in the end, we mixed them up.

* 400 g dried soaked and peeled fava beans
* 200g dried, soaked chickpeas

Dry on tea towels, really as dry as you can get them. Leave them out if necessary to dry for a few hours.

Then take

* two  big handfuls of fresh coriander and fresh flat leaf parsley
* a medium sized onion

Chop finely in the food processor – again I had to guess for how long here but it came out ok with a few shreddy bits. If you want golden middles to your falafel omit the herbs and use something like turmeric to colour the insides.

Process the soaked pulses in a food processor or blender until they are soft and barely gritty to the touch.  They are quite hard to do as they are so dry so we ended up taking big spoonfuls out and redoing them several times.

Mix the reserved green herbs and onions that you processed previously in with the processed pulses.

Add (here you might want to adjust quantities as it is very much a question of personal taste)

* 6 large garlic cloves which had been put through a garlic press
* 1½ tsp of seasalt,
* 2-3 tsps of freshly ground cumin
* 2-3 tsps of ground coriander seed,
* ¼-½ tsp of hot chilli powder
* a tsp of baking powder.
* I put a few spoons of chick pea flour and I think that helped to bind

We left the paste to chill for an hour in the fridge and cooked some the first night to see if they were going to hold together or fall apart.

Fry in 180 degrees.
