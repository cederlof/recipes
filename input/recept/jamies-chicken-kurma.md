Instructions:
     
1. Cut chicken breasts into 1½ inch chunks or, if using joints, separate leg from thigh.
2. Mix the chicken with the ginger and yogurt and cover and leave to marinade for 3-4 hours or in the fridge overnight.
3. Put the chopped onion, red chillies and garlic into a food processor or liquidiser and liquidise to a smooth paste. If the mix is too dry add a little water.
4. In a wok or large cast-iron pot, heat 4 tbsps of the ghee or oil over medium heat and fry the sliced onions until they are golden-brown. Remove the pan from the heat and, using a slotted spoon, transfer the onions to a bowl for use later. Leave any remaining oil in the pan.
5. Add the remaining 2 tbsps ghee or of oil to the pan over medium heat.
6. When hot, add the ground coriander, garam masala and turmeric stirring rapidly for about 1-minute (take pan off the heat if the oil is too hot).
7. Adjust the heat to medium and add the chicken along with the marinade. Stir fry for about 10-minutes.
8. Add the liquidised spices and continue to stir-fry for about 8-minutes.
9. Add the water and slice the creamed coconut into the pan. Bring to the boil stirring until the coconut is dissolved.
10. Add the fried onions and salt.
11. Reduce heat to low, cover the pan and simmer until the chicken is tender (30-40 minutes).
12. Remove from heat, sprinkle on the ground almonds, chopped coriander leaves and lemon juice and mix well.
